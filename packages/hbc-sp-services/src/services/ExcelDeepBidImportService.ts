// TODO (Stage 19 – Sub-task 2): Create this new file (mirror SharePointDataService.ts contract). Implement full ExcelDeepBidImportService class using exceljs to read ALL worksheets, detect CSI/merged-scope signatures, "DetailsTier", labor-rate tables. Normalize to exactly one primary Cost Summary (highest grand-total or flagged) and one primary GC&GR (best duration match). Persist raw multi-version tree + original file. Support Hilltop R2.xlsx and Wellington R2.1-BF.xlsx as golden tests. Commit only after both files parse correctly to single primary + full raw tree.

// TODO (Stage 19 – Sub-task 8): Add per-section confidence scoring (e.g., 98% for Hilltop scopes); fallback to manual mapping UI if <90%. Always store raw file. Extend AuditService logging. Reference: plan error handling, confidence scoring & fallback deliverable.
